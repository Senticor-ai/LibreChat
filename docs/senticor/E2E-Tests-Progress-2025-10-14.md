# E2E Tests Progress Report - October 14, 2025

## Executive Summary

Successfully fixed critical authentication and selector issues in Playwright E2E tests. Tests now successfully:
- ‚úÖ Authenticate with LibreChat
- ‚úÖ Navigate to chat interface
- ‚úÖ Select "My Agents" endpoint
- ‚úÖ Send messages

**Current Status:** Tests work up to agent selection. Next step: implement specific agent selection before message sending.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Fixed Authentication Issue
**Problem:** Tests were failing because LibreChat was running in production mode with `secure: true` cookies, which don't work over HTTP.

**Solution:** Modified `docker-compose.override.yml` to use `npm run backend:dev` instead of `npm run backend`. This sets `NODE_ENV=development` which uses `secure: false` for cookies, making them work with HTTP test URLs.

**Files:**
- `docker-compose.override.yml` - Added dev mode command override

### 2. Fixed Selector Issues
**Problem:** Tests were using outdated selectors like `#new-conversation-menu` which don't exist in current LibreChat UI.

**Solution:**
- Identified correct UI structure through debug tests
- Model selector is a button with role="combobox"
- Endpoint dropdown contains "My Agents", "StackIT Agents", etc.
- Updated selectors to match current UI

**Files:**
- `e2e/specs/demo-steps-1-6-focused.spec.ts` - New focused test with correct selectors

### 3. Switched to Manual Login
**Problem:** Storage state authentication wasn't reliably persisting between test runs.

**Solution:** Created `loginUser()` function that logs in fresh for each test. More reliable than storage state approach.

**Files:**
- `generate-auth.js` - Helper script for generating auth (kept for reference)
- Test now uses manual login in beforeEach hook

### 4. Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation:
- `E2E-TESTING.md` - Quick reference for running tests
- `docs/senticor/E2E-Tests-SOLUTION.md` - Complete technical solution
- `docs/senticor/E2E-Test-Plan-Steps-1-8.md` - Full test plan for all steps

## Test Output

```
‚úÖ Logged in
üìù STEP 1: Projekt starten & Honeycomb erstellen
Found 1 potential model selector buttons
üì∏ Model dropdown screenshot saved to /tmp/model-dropdown.png
‚úÖ Selected My Agents
üì§ Sent: Ich erstelle den Integrationsbericht Baden-W√ºrttemberg 2025 ...
```

**Current Blocker:** After sending message, LibreChat shows "Please select an Agent" - need to implement agent selection before sending messages.

## Viewing Test Execution

To view the full test trace including video/screenshots:
```bash
npx playwright show-trace e2e/specs/.test-results/demo-steps-1-6-focused-Dem-c3a65-omb-for-Integrationsbericht-chromium/trace.zip
```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Agent Selection** - Add logic to select a specific agent after choosing "My Agents" endpoint
2. **Extend to Steps 2-6** - Once Step 1 works completely, extend test coverage
3. **Add Validation** - Verify HIVE API interactions (honeycomb creation, entity additions)
4. **Performance Testing** - Optimize timeout values for AI/MCP operations

- `docs/senticor/Demo-NEU-Implementation-Status.md` - Superseded

## Technical Details

### Root Cause of Authentication Failure

The issue was in [api/server/services/AuthService.js:32](api/server/services/AuthService.js#L32):

```javascript
const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
// ...
secure: isProduction  // Line 389, 395
```

When running `npm run backend`, NODE_ENV is set to 'production', causing cookies with `secure: true`. Browsers refuse to send secure cookies over HTTP, causing all authenticated requests to fail.

### LibreChat UI Structure

Current UI (v0.8.0) uses:
- **Model Selector**: Button with `role="combobox"` containing current model name (e.g., "gpt-5")
- **Endpoint Dropdown**: Opens on click, contains options like "OpenAI", "My Agents", "Google", etc.
- **Agent Selection**: Required after selecting "My Agents" endpoint

The old `#new-conversation-menu` selector is obsolete and doesn't exist in current version.

## Estimated Effort Remaining

- **Agent Selection Implementation**: 1-2 hours
- **Complete Step 1 Test**: 2-3 hours
- **Steps 2-6 Tests**: 1 day
- **Steps 7-8 Tests**: 0.5 day
- **Total**: ~2-3 days for complete test suite

## Conclusion

Significant progress made on E2E testing infrastructure. Core authentication and navigation issues resolved. Tests are now stable and can be extended to cover the full demo workflow. The trace files provide excellent visibility into test execution for debugging.
