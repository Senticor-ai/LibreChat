# MCP LLM Access: Summary and Action Plan

## Quick Answer to "How to Access the LLM?"

### The Situation

**What Hive MCP team needs:** Access to LLM from within the MCP server for semantic analysis, ontology reasoning, query generation, etc.

**What MCP provides:** A feature called **"Sampling"** (`sampling/createMessage` method) that lets MCP servers request LLM completions from the client.

**LibreChat's current status:** ❌ **Sampling is NOT implemented** - the MCP client is initialized with empty capabilities.

## Two Paths Forward

### Path 1: Request Sampling Support from LibreChat (Long-term)

**What to do:**
- Submit feature request to LibreChat team
- Reference the detailed document: [`MCP-SAMPLING-FEATURE-REQUEST.md`](./MCP-SAMPLING-FEATURE-REQUEST.md)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Your MCP server can directly request LLM completions
- ✅ No API keys needed in your server
- ✅ User maintains control over model selection
- ✅ Enables true agentic workflows

**Timeline:**
- Likely 3-5 weeks if LibreChat team prioritizes it
- May take longer if they have other priorities

**Best for:**
- Use cases requiring autonomous multi-step LLM reasoning
- Complex workflows where MCP server orchestrates multiple LLM calls
- When your server needs to process LLM responses internally before returning results

### Path 2: Work Around It (Immediate)

**What to do:**
- Design tools to return **data + prompts** instead of processed results
- Let the agent's LLM do the reasoning
- Reference the detailed guide: [`HIVE-MCP-WORKAROUND-WITHOUT-SAMPLING.md`](./HIVE-MCP-WORKAROUND-WITHOUT-SAMPLING.md)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Can implement TODAY
- ✅ Works with current LibreChat
- ✅ Simpler architecture (no LLM management in your server)
- ✅ Still enables rich semantic interactions

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Your server can't do autonomous reasoning
- ⚠️ Can't perform multiple LLM calls within one tool execution
- ⚠️ Agent's LLM does all the thinking (not your server)

**Best for:**
- Most common use cases (data retrieval, query assistance, enrichment suggestions)
- When you need to ship functionality soon
- Workflows where the agent's LLM making decisions is acceptable

## Our Recommendation

### For Hive MCP Team: Use Path 2 Now

**Why:**
1. **You can build and ship immediately** - no need to wait for LibreChat changes
2. **Most of your use cases fit Path 2 patterns:**
   - Semantic analysis: Return RDF data + analysis prompts
   - Ontology suggestions: Return entity data + enrichment suggestions
   - Query assistance: Return schema + query templates + prompt
   - Data enrichment: Multi-step workflow where agent decides, you execute

3. **It's not a compromise** - it's a valid architectural approach:
   - Your MCP server focuses on **data and domain logic**
   - The agent's LLM handles **reasoning and language understanding**
   - Clean separation of concerns!

4. **Minimal risk:**
   - If LibreChat adds sampling later, you can enhance your tools
   - Your current implementation won't be wasted

### For LibreChat Team: Consider Path 1

We've created a detailed feature request with:
- Implementation requirements
- Code examples
- Security considerations
- Testing strategy
- Timeline estimates

See: [`MCP-SAMPLING-FEATURE-REQUEST.md`](./MCP-SAMPLING-FEATURE-REQUEST.md)

## Communication Plan

### To Hive MCP Team

**Message:**
> "Good news! We've investigated the LLM access question.
>
> While LibreChat doesn't currently support MCP sampling (the standard way for servers to access LLMs), we've identified a practical workaround that should work for most of your use cases.
>
> **Recommended approach:** Design your tools to return structured data with conversational prompts, and let the agent's LLM do the reasoning. This works today and doesn't require waiting for LibreChat changes.
>
> See the detailed guide: `HIVE-MCP-WORKAROUND-WITHOUT-SAMPLING.md`
>
> **Key pattern:**
> ```typescript
> // Instead of: server calls LLM → returns processed result
> // Do: server returns data + prompt → agent's LLM processes it
> ```
>
> This unblocks your development immediately. When LibreChat adds sampling support later, you can enhance your tools with more autonomous reasoning capabilities."

### To LibreChat Team (Optional)

**Message:**
> "We'd like to request MCP Sampling support for LibreChat.
>
> Sampling (`sampling/createMessage`) is a core MCP feature that allows servers to request LLM completions from clients. This enables sophisticated agentic workflows while maintaining user control and security.
>
> **Use cases:**
> - Semantic analysis of RDF graphs (Hive MCP)
> - Legal document analysis (Rechtsinformationen MCP)
> - Any MCP server needing LLM assistance
>
> **Current state:** LibreChat initializes MCP clients with empty capabilities (no sampling)
>
> **What's needed:** See detailed feature request with implementation guide: `MCP-SAMPLING-FEATURE-REQUEST.md`
>
> We're happy to contribute to implementation or provide testing/feedback."

## Example Conversation Flow

### User Asks:
"How do I access the LLM from my Hive MCP server?"

### Your Answer:
"LibreChat doesn't currently support MCP sampling (the standard way), but here's what you can do:

**Option 1 (Immediate):** Design your tools to return data + prompts, let the agent's LLM process them. This works for most use cases and you can implement it today. See: `HIVE-MCP-WORKAROUND-WITHOUT-SAMPLING.md`

**Option 2 (Long-term):** Request sampling support from LibreChat. We've created a detailed feature request for this. See: `MCP-SAMPLING-FEATURE-REQUEST.md`

For most Hive use cases (semantic analysis, query assistance, data enrichment), **Option 1 is sufficient** and you don't need to wait."

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Should Hive MCP team wait for sampling support?
**A:** No, use the workaround (Option 2) now. Most use cases work fine with it.

### Q: What if our use case truly needs sampling?
**A:** First, try to redesign using workaround patterns. If it's truly impossible, then you'd need to wait for or contribute to implementing sampling support in LibreChat.

### Q: Can we implement sampling support ourselves?
**A:** Yes! The feature request document includes implementation details. You could contribute a PR to LibreChat.

### Q: What's the timeline for LibreChat to add sampling?
**A:** Unknown. They need to prioritize it. Estimate: 3-5 weeks if prioritized, longer if not.

### Q: Will our workaround code be wasted if sampling is added later?
**A:** No! The workaround approach (returning rich data + prompts) is good design. You can keep it and optionally enhance specific tools with sampling when available.

## Conclusion

**Bottom line for Hive MCP team:**

> You're not blocked! Use Option 2 (the workaround) to build your tools now. Design them to return structured data with conversational prompts, and the agent's LLM will handle the reasoning. This is a valid, production-ready approach that works today.

**Bottom line for LibreChat:**

> Sampling support would be valuable for the MCP ecosystem and would bring LibreChat to full spec compliance. We've documented what's needed and are happy to help with implementation.
